# UI States, Forms, Content, Quotes, Theme Lock

LLMs default to clichés. Override these defaults proactively. Each rule has a context-aware override path.

## 4.5 Interactive UI States
LLMs default to "static successful state only." Always implement full cycles:
* **Loading:** Skeletal loaders matching the final layout's shape. Avoid generic circular spinners.
* **Empty States:** Beautifully composed; indicate how to populate.
* **Error States:** Clear, inline (forms), or contextual (toasts only for transient).
* **Tactile Feedback:** On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push.
* **BUTTON CONTRAST CHECK (mandatory, a11y):** Before shipping any button, verify the button text is readable against the button background. White button + white text, `bg-white` CTA with `text-white` label, transparent button against the page background with no border → all banned. Audit every CTA: contrast ratio WCAG AA min (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text 18px+). Same rule applies to ghost buttons over photographic backgrounds (use a backdrop, scrim, or stroke).
* **CTA BUTTON WRAP BAN (mandatory):** Button text MUST fit on one line at desktop. If a label like "VIEW SELECTED WORK" wraps to 2 or 3 lines, the button is broken. Fix by EITHER shortening the label (3 words max for primary CTAs, ideally 1-2) OR widening the button (do not artificially constrain `max-width` on CTAs). Wrapped CTAs at desktop are a Pre-Flight Fail.
* **NO DUPLICATE CTA INTENT (mandatory):** Two CTAs with the same intent on one page is a Pre-Flight Fail. Examples of same intent: "Get in touch" + "Contact us" + "Let's talk" + "Start a project" + "Start something" + "Reach out" = all "contact" intent → pick ONE label and use it everywhere on the page (nav, hero, footer). Same for "Try free" + "Get started" + "Sign up free" (all "signup" intent) and "View work" + "See selected work" + "Browse projects" (all "portfolio" intent). One label per intent.
* **FORM CONTRAST CHECK (mandatory, a11y):** Form inputs, placeholder text, focus rings, helper text, and error text all pass WCAG AA contrast against the section background. Light placeholders on a near-white form, white form on white page section, form labels grayer than 4.5:1 contrast → all banned. Audit every form before shipping.

## 4.6 Data & Form Patterns
* Label ABOVE input. Helper text optional but present in markup. Error text BELOW input. Standard `gap-2` for input blocks.
* No placeholder-as-label. Ever.

## 4.9 Content Density

Landing pages live on the **first impression**, not the full read. Cut ruthlessly.

* **Default content shape per section:** short headline (≤ 8 words) + short sub-paragraph (≤ 25 words) + one visual asset OR one CTA. Anything more must be justified by the section's job.
* **No data-dump sections.** A 20-row publication table, a 30-row award list, a giant pricing matrix on a marketing page = wrong layout. Use:
  - Top 3-5 highlights + "View full list" link
  - Marquee / carousel for breadth
  - Different page entirely if the data is the product
* **Long lists need a different UI component, not a longer list.** Default `<ul>` with bullets / `divide-y` rows is the lazy choice. If you have > 5 items, reach for one of these instead:
  - 2-column split with grouped items
  - Card grid with image + label per item
  - Tabs / accordion if items are categorisable
  - Horizontal scroll-snap pills
  - Carousel for breadth-heavy lists (testimonials, logos, capabilities)
  - Marquee for "lots-of-things-that-don't-need-individual-attention"
  A spec sheet with 10 rows + a hairline under every row is the WORST default. Either group rows into 2-3 chunks with sparse dividers, or move to a card-per-spec layout.
* **Spec sheets specifically (the Marrow-cookware pattern).** A long product specification table with `border-b` on every row is the AI default for cookware / hardware / apparel / artisan-goods briefs. Banned. Concrete alternatives:
  - **2-col card grid:** each spec gets its own card with the spec name, the value (large display number), and a one-line "why it matters" body. Cards arranged 2-col on desktop, 1-col mobile.
  - **Scroll-snap horizontal pills:** each spec is a pill, user can flick through.
  - **Grouped chunks:** group 10 specs into 3 logical clusters (e.g. "Materials", "Cooking", "Warranty"), each cluster gets ONE soft divider and a cluster heading.
  - **Featured-vs-rest:** 3-4 hero specs visualised as large display tiles, the rest collapsed under a "View full specifications" disclosure.

* **COPY SELF-AUDIT (mandatory before ship):** Before declaring any task done, re-read every visible string on the page (headlines, subheads, eyebrows, button labels, body copy, captions, alt text, footer text, error messages). Flag any string that is:
  - **Grammatically broken** ("free on its past", "two plans but one is honest", "to put it on the table" out of context)
  - **Has unclear referents** ("we plan to stay that way" without prior context)
  - **Sounds like AI hallucination** (cute-but-wrong wordplay, forced metaphors that don't track, "elegant nothing" phrases)
  - **Reads like an LLM trying to sound thoughtful** (passive-aggressive humility, fake-craftsman labels, mock-poetic micro-meta)
  Rewrite every flagged string. If unsure whether a string makes sense, replace it with a plain functional sentence. AI-generated cute copy is worse than boring copy.
* **Fake-precise numbers are flagged.** Numbers like `92%`, `4.1×`, `48k`, `5.8 mm`, `13.4 lb` either:
  - Come from real data (brief, brand guidelines, public metrics) - fine
  - Are explicitly labeled as mock (`<!-- mock -->`, "example", "sample data") - fine
  - Are AI-invented spec aesthetics - banned. Don't fake engineering precision the brand doesn't claim.
* **One copy register per page.** Don't mix technical mono ("47 tasks · 0.6 ctx-switches/day"), editorial prose, and marketing punch in the same composition unless the brand voice explicitly calls for it.

## 4.10 Quotes & Testimonials

* **Max 3 lines** of quote body. Never 6. If the original quote is longer → cut it. A landing-page quote is a snippet, not the full review.
* For very small font sizes (e.g. footer-style testimonials), the line cap can stretch slightly. Spirit: "fits in a glance."
* **No em-dashes inside the quote text** as design flourish (long pauses, kinetic em-dashes, em-dash-bullets). See Section 9.G (references/ai-tells.md) - em-dash is completely banned.
* Attribution: name + role + (optionally) company. Never name only ("- Sarah").
* Quote marks: use real typographic quotes ( " " ) or none at all. Not straight ASCII ( " ).

## 4.11 Page Theme Lock (Light / Dark Mode Consistency)

The page has ONE theme. Sections do not invert.

* If the page is dark mode, ALL sections are dark mode. No light-mode-warm-paper section sandwiched between dark sections (or vice versa). The user must not feel they walked into a different website mid-scroll.
* The exception: if the brief explicitly calls for a "Color Block Story" or "Theme Switch on Scroll" device AND that is a deliberate composition (one full theme switch with a strong transition, not random alternation), it is allowed once per page.
* Default behaviour: pick light, dark, or auto (`prefers-color-scheme`) at the page level and lock it. Section-level background tints within the same theme family are fine (`bg-zinc-950` next to `bg-zinc-900`); flipping to `bg-amber-50` in the middle of a `bg-zinc-950` page is broken.
* When using a design system with built-in theming (Radix Themes, shadcn/ui with `<Theme>`), set the theme ONCE in `layout.tsx` or the page root. Do not let individual sections override.
