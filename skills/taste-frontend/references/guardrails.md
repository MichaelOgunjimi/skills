# Performance, Accessibility and Dark Mode Guardrails

## 6. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY GUARDRAILS

### 6.A Hardware Acceleration
* Animate ONLY `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`.
* Use `will-change: transform` sparingly - only on elements that will actually animate.

### 6.B Reduced Motion (mandatory)
* **Any motion above `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3` MUST honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.** This is non-negotiable.
* In Motion: wrap with `useReducedMotion()` and degrade to static.
* In CSS: gate animations behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or provide an override block under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` that disables.
* Infinite loops, parallax, scroll-hijack, and magnetic physics MUST collapse to static / instant under reduced motion.

### 6.C Dark Mode (mandatory for any consumer-facing page)
* Design for **both modes from the start**. Never ship light-only or dark-only without explicit user instruction.
* Use Tailwind `dark:` variant OR CSS variables for tokens. Pick one strategy per project.
* **Do not prescribe specific dark-mode colors here.** The brief decides. Maintain visual hierarchy, brand identity, and WCAG AA contrast (AAA for body) across both modes.
* Respect `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Default to system preference unless the brand insists on one mode.

### 6.D Core Web Vitals Targets
* **LCP** < 2.5s. Hero image must be `next/image priority` or preloaded.
* **INP** < 200ms. Heavy work off main thread.
* **CLS** < 0.1. Reserve space for images, fonts, embeds.
* Run Lighthouse before declaring a page done.

### 6.E DOM Cost
* Apply grain / noise filters EXCLUSIVELY to fixed, `pointer-events-none` pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-[60] pointer-events-none`). NEVER on scrolling containers - continuous GPU repaints destroy mobile FPS.
* Be aware of bundle size. Motion is not tiny. Three.js is large. Lazy-load anything that's not above-the-fold.

### 6.F Z-Index Restraint
NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10`. Use z-index strictly for systemic layer contexts (sticky navbars, modals, overlays, grain). Document the z-index scale in a project constants file.

## 8. DARK MODE PROTOCOL

Dual-mode by default. Never assume light-only unless the brief is print-emulating editorial.

### 8.A Token Strategy (pick one, stick to it)
* **Tailwind `dark:` variant** (default for utility-first projects): every color utility paired with its dark variant (`bg-white dark:bg-zinc-950`, `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`).
* **CSS variables** (for shadcn/ui, Radix Themes, or component libraries with theming): define semantic tokens (`--surface`, `--surface-elevated`, `--text-primary`, `--accent`) and swap values under `[data-theme="dark"]` or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

### 8.B Do Not Prescribe Specific Colors Here
The brief and brand decide. This skill enforces only:
* **Contrast** - WCAG AA minimum for body text, AAA target for hero copy.
* **Hierarchy parity** - visual hierarchy that works in light must work in dark. If a CTA pops in light, it pops in dark.
* **Brand fidelity** - primary brand color stays recognisable. Don't desaturate the brand into a dark mode.
* **No pure `#000000` and no pure `#ffffff`** - use off-black (zinc-950, near-black warm gray) and off-white. Pure values kill depth.

### 8.C Default Mode
Respect `prefers-color-scheme` unless the brand insists. Add a manual toggle if either mode would lose key brand expression.

### 8.D Test in Both Modes Before Finishing
Open the page in both modes during development. Do not ship a page you've only seen in one mode.
